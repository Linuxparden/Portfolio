        <h3 id="fufu">1. Fufu</h3>
        <p>Fufu (or foofoo, foufou) is one of the most commonly eaten Nigerian foods. It refers to a staple food made from cassava (fermented or unfermented) that&rsquo;s been boiled, pounded, and then formed into balls. </p>
        <p>Traditionally, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="images/nigerian-food-fufu.jpg.webp" target="_blank">fufu</a> refers to a staple Nigerian food made with cassava. However, the definition has expanded over the years to include other staple foods made from similarly starchy ingredients like yam, plantains, maize, wheat, rice, and semo. The term fufu refers to a specific dish but it can also be used as an umbrella term to describe a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lowcarbafrica.com/what-is-fufu-foo-foo/" target="_blank">family of starchy staple foods</a> commonly eaten in Nigeria, Ghana, and other parts of Africa.</p>
        <p>To make fufu, boiled cassava is peeled and then cut into small cubes before pounding. Traditionally, a large wooden mortar and pestle is used. The cassava is pounded into a smooth and sticky mixture before being shaped into balls and served. It&rsquo;s popular throughout western and central Africa and is typically eaten with different types of soups and stews.</p>
        <p>Fufu &ndash; like pounded yam, <a href="#amala-ewedu-soup">amala</a>, and <a href="#eba">eba</a> &ndash; is a type of Nigerian swallow food. Swallow foods are starchy doughy dishes that are soft and pliable enough to swallow without chewing. To eat, a small portion is torn off and used as a scoop for soups and stews. Like many staple foods, it has a mild taste, similar to potatoes. </p>

        <h3 id="eba">2. Eba</h3>
        <p>Eba is a popular Nigerian swallow food made with dried and fried cassava flour called garri. It&rsquo;s eaten like fufu and often served alongside many Nigerian soups and stews. </p>
        <p>To prepare, cassava tubers are peeled and crushed into a mash before being pressed, dried, and fried to produce a dry granular flour called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garri" target="_blank">garri</a>. The garri is then mixed with boiling water to form a smooth stiff dough that&rsquo;s shaped into balls and consumed.</p>
        <p>Eba can be either off-white or yellowish in color. Yellow eba is made with garri that&rsquo;s been fried in palm oil.</p>

        <h3 id="tuwo-shinkafa">3. Tuwo Shinkafa</h3>
        <p>Tuwo Shinkafa is a type of Nigerian swallow food associated with the Hausa people of northern Nigeria. It&rsquo;s traditionally made with short-grain rice but it can be made with rice flour as well. </p>
        <p>To prepare, the rice is boiled until it absorbs the water and becomes soft and sticky. It&rsquo;s then mashed into a soft dough, shaped into the container that it&rsquo;s introduced to, and formed into balls before being served as an accompaniment to Nigerian soups like miyan kuka and miyan kardashi.</p>

        <h3 id="jollof-rice">4. Jollof Rice</h3>
        <p>Jollof rice is a one-pot rice dish that&rsquo;s popular in many West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Togo, and Gambia. It&rsquo;s made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, pimento peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, salt, and other spices. </p>
        <p>Jollof rice is one of the most widely consumed dishes in West Africa. It&rsquo;s regarded as a national dish in Nigeria and often served with some type of meat like chicken, turkey, beef, or fish. Many variations of jollof rice exist in West Africa with two of the most well-known being the Nigerian and Ghanian versions.</p>
        <p>Nigerians and Ghanians are so passionate about this dish that it&rsquo;s sparked the &ldquo;Jollof wars&rdquo; &ndash; a heated but friendly debate on which nation makes the best version of this beloved dish. The two versions are fairly similar with the one main difference being that Nigerian jollof rice is made with long-grain rice while the Ghanian version is made with more aromatic basmati.</p>

        <h3 id="egusi-soup">5. Egusi Soup</h3>
        <p>Egusi soup with <a href="#fufu">fufu</a> is considered by many to be a Nigerian national dish. Egusi refers to the protein-rich seeds of plants like squash, melon, and gourd that when dried and ground become a staple ingredient in many West African and Nigerian foods. One of those dishes is egusi soup.</p>
        <p>Egusi soup is a one-pot meal typically made with ground egusi, palm oil, onions, hot peppers, locust beans (iru), African crayfish, stockfish, some type of meat, fish, and leafy vegetables. Other than fufu, it can served with other Nigerian swallow foods like eba, amala, or pounded yam.</p>
